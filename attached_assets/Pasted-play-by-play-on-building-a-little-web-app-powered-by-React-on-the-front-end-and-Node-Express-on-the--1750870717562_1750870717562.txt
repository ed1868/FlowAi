play-by-play on building a little web app—powered by React on the front end and Node/Express on the back end—that helps you lock in those deep-work sprints, micro-check-ins, journaling, voice-notes, and reset-kit rituals. Think of it as your own kitchen-style productivity station.

1. Sketch your feature set & data model
Timer module: start/pause/reset 90-min sprints + break reminders

Check-in scheduler: quick pop-up or notif at set times

Journaling: text entries + timestamp

Voice-note upload: record in browser, save as audio file

Reset kit actions: list of rituals with “Done” buttons

User accounts (optional): to persist across devices

Draw boxes and arrows on a whiteboard or Miro—what data each feature needs (e.g. a “Session” object with start, end, type).

2. Bootstrap your repo & environments
Git init (or clone an org template)

Create two folders: /server and /client

In /server, run npm init -y

In /client, use Vite or CRA:

bash
Copy
Edit
# example with Vite
cd client
npm create vite@latest . --template react
npm install
3. Build the Node/Express API
Install deps:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
npm install express mongoose dotenv cors multer
Wire up server.js:

js
Copy
Edit
import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
const app = express();
app.use(cors(), express.json());
// routes go here
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 4000, ()=> console.log('API live'));
Connect to MongoDB (or your DB of choice) with Mongoose in a separate db.js.

Define models (Session, CheckIn, JournalEntry, VoiceNote, User).

4. Create your REST endpoints
Sessions: POST /api/sessions (start), PATCH /api/sessions/:id (end), GET /api/sessions

CheckIns: POST /api/checkins, GET /api/checkins

Journal: CRUD /api/journal

VoiceNotes: file upload with Multer to /uploads, endpoints to POST /api/voice and GET /api/voice

ResetKit: static JSON on the client or store state in DB

Test each route with Postman or Insomnia.

5. Secure & structure your API
Use Helmet, express-rate-limit, and cors whitelisting

If you need auth, drop in JWT: npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs

Create an auth middleware to protect routes

6. Spin up your React front end
Install core libs:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
npm install axios react-router-dom
Set up folder structure:

swift
Copy
Edit
src/
  components/ Timer/, CheckIn/, Journal/, VoiceNote/, ResetKit/
  pages/ Dashboard.jsx, Login.jsx, Signup.jsx
  services/ api.js
  App.jsx
  index.jsx
Configure routing in App.jsx with React Router.

7. Build your main components
Timer component:

use useState for minutes/seconds

useEffect + setInterval to tick down

on “session end,” call your API to save the record

CheckIn scheduler:

let user pick times (HTML <input type="time">)

schedule with setTimeout or use the Notifications API for browser pops

save schedules via POST /api/checkins

Journal: simple textarea + “Save” button → POST /api/journal

VoiceNote: use the MediaRecorder API to record; upload blob via FormData → POST /api/voice

ResetKit: render a static list of actions (e.g. “Stretch,” “Cold splash,” “Play hype track”), each with a checkbox + timestamp save (optional)

8. Wire up API calls
In services/api.js, export functions like getSessions(), createSession(), etc., using Axios. Then call those in your component event handlers (e.g. onStart, onStop, onSave).

9. Style & polish
Use your go-to: Tailwind, Chakra UI, Material, whatever vibes with you

Make the layout mobile-friendly—charts and timers should scale

Add a simple Navbar with links to Dashboard, Journal, etc.

10. Add state management (optional)
For a small app, Context + useReducer is enough

For bigger scale, drop in Redux Toolkit

11. Testing
Back end: Jest + Supertest for your endpoints

Front end: React Testing Library for components

12. Deployment
Server: Deploy to Heroku, Render, or Fly.io

Client: Vercel or Netlify—point to your build folder, set env vars for your API URL

Ensure CORS is configured on the live API.

13. Monitor & iterate
Hook up simple analytics (e.g. Plausible, Google Analytics) to see how often you hit breaks, journaling, etc.

Use error tracking (Sentry) to catch any crashes.
